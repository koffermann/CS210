<b> 1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. </b>
<br>The purpose of this project was to simulate being a software developer for a company called Chada Tech. Chada Tech needed a program written for a grocery store (Grocer's Corner) that will allow users to either get a list of all items sold that day with the amount sold, search for a specific item and its quantity sold, or receive a histogram graph to visually represent items sold that day. My task as the developer was to create a program that would allow users to select one of these options from a menu, and to keep them "logged in" with a loop until they enter a command to exit the program. </i>

<b> 2. What did you do particularly well? </b>
<br> I believe what I did well was build a program that took advantage of Python's strength in handling data. It was a rough ride trying to connect Python and Visual Basic during this course, but finally getting them to work together and then backing off of the things I learned in C++ a little to really take advantage of this newly established connection between the programs was something I not only accomplished, but something I ended up becoming really proud of in the end. 
<br>
<br>  
<b> 3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? </b>
<br> If I could enhance my code, I would take my professor's feedback and improve the program's formatting. Putting more care into the layout of the menu would make navigation easier for the users.
<br>
    
<b> 4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? </b>

<b> 5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? </b>

<b> 6. # How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? </b>
