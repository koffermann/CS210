<b> 1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. </b>
<br>The purpose of this project was to simulate being a software developer for a company called Chada Tech. Chada Tech needed a program written for a grocery store (Grocer's Corner) that will allow users to either get a list of all items sold that day with the amount sold, search for a specific item and its quantity sold, or receive a histogram graph to visually represent items sold that day. My task as the developer was to create a program that would allow users to select one of these options from a menu, and to keep them "logged in" with a loop until they enter a command to exit the program. </i>

<b> 2. What did you do particularly well? </b>
<br> I believe what I did well was build a program that took advantage of Python's strength in handling data. It was a rough ride trying to connect Python and Visual Basic during this course, but finally getting them to work together and then backing off of the things I learned in C++ a little to really take advantage of this newly established connection between the programs was something I not only accomplished, but something I ended up becoming really proud of in the end. 
<br>
<br>  
<b> 3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? </b>
<br> If I could enhance my code, I would take my professor's feedback and improve the program's formatting. Putting more care into the layout of the menu would make navigation easier for the users.
<br> 
<b> 4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? </b>
<br> The most challenging piece of code to write was the code to save the histogram to a .dat file. I had an issue where the file kept saving with nothing in it, and then another issue aftert that where it kept saving the first line and nothing else. Ultimately, I returned to zybooks and found returned to the textbook for Python. Going through the entire chapter and looking at old challenges/labs helped me to recall the proper way to write the histogram to a file. On top of zybooks, I plan to add sites like geeksforgeeks.org, stackoverflow.com, and w3schools.com to tools/resources in my support network. 
<br> 
<b> 5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? </b>
<br> I believe the skill to read, write, and create new files will be extremely helpful in other projects and course work. Since I will possibly be working with team members in the future, learning to integrate imported documents into codes I have will be a useful technique to have. It is a skill that I still need practice with but being able to master it will be great in the long run.

<b> 6. # How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? </b>
<br><i> I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by putting myself in the shoes of the client and user. If I wrote something that was too complicated and offered no explanation then the client would have a hard time understanding what was being done with the program they requested. It would also make it harder for them to make small adjustments to verbiage, menu styles, and any other minor adjustments without a clear understanding of what blocks of codes were written to do. Labelling things well also allows the code to be adapted into different (yet similar) programs when needed. In short, I did my best to keep things simple and explain my every step to avoid confusion. </i>
